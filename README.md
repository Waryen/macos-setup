# MacOS setup script

Simple script to install everything I need to get started on a MacOS

## Getting started

- Have ruby installed, recent versions of macOS are shipped with ruby
- Give exec permission to the script and run it, you will need privilege access
- ```bash
  chmod +x ./setup.rb && ./setup.rb
  ```
Done!
