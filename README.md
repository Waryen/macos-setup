# macOS setup script

Simple scripts to install everything I need to get started on macOS

## Getting started

- Have ruby installed, recent versions of macOS are shipped with ruby
- Give exec permission to the scripts and run them in the correct order, you will need privilege access
- ```bash
    chmod +x ./setup1.rb && ruby ./setup1.rb
    chmod +x ./setup2.rb && ruby ./setup2.rb
  ```
  Done!
